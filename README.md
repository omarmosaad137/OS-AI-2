- username: `lawyer`
- password: `Lawyer@123`

Client user:
- username: `client`

## Important security note

The demo login stores usernames/passwords in browser storage so you can test quickly.
Do not use this for real client data until proper authentication is connected.

Production authentication should use:
- Supabase Auth
- Firebase Auth
- Auth0
- Clerk
- or a custom secure backend

## Install locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Upload this folder to GitHub.
2. Import into Vercel.
3. Settings:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Output directory: dist
4. Deploy.

## Enable real AI

In Vercel:

1. Project Settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Add:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

4. Redeploy.

The AI key is used only in `/api/ai.js`, never in frontend browser code.


## v2.1 fixes

This package fixes two issues seen in the screenshots:

1. Template preview line breaks:
   - Old saved templates may show literal `\n`.
   - The app now normalizes saved templates, emails and updates so line breaks render properly.
   - A `Reset Demo Data` button was added in Settings if old browser data still causes issues.

2. AI error message:
   - `/api/ai` now returns a detailed configuration checklist instead of only `OpenAI API request failed`.
   - The model is configurable using:

```text
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.2
```

If no `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured, the AI page returns a demo response instead of failing.
